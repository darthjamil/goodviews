# UX Log
The purpose of the site is to give you quality suggestions for movies to watch.  

The main vehicle for doing this is to provide a social network for people to share 
their movies, ratings, and thoughts with their friends. Ideally, though, we 
provide as much value to users without an account as possible - by way of similar 
movies, browse by genre, popular/trending, etc.  

## Fictional Personas
Persona | Description | Motives | Pain Points
:---: | --- | --- | ---
Nick ![Image of Nick](personas/Nick.png) | Nick is a tech-savvy product designer working for a big-name design firm in Manhattan. He's successful, unmarried, and keeps himself busy. | Nick loves watching movies. He uses them to unwind. He consumes about a movie a week, on average. He has subscriptions to Netflix, Disney+, and rents new releases on Google Play. His recommendations come largely from his family and coworkers. He's into action, sci-fi, and fantasy, and MPAA ratings and user reviews on parental guidelines are important to him. | Nick gets bored easily, and wants recommendations often and quickly. He wants to be able to keep a backlog of movies to watch, but chances are he loses interest in the movies on a list quickly. He doesn't watch movies based on simple criteria like genre alone; he's interested in minor things, like plot twists.
Fatima ![Image of Fatima](personas/Fatima.png) | Fatima is a director of HR for a small company in the US. She's married with four children. She loves to travel, explore new things, and she watches movies almost on a nightly basis with her husband, despite their busy schedules. They have a fancy 4K projector and home-theater setup going. Sometimes they'll watch movies with the kids, but usually it's when the kids have gone to bed. | If Fatima doesn't like a movie, she falls asleep. And this happens not too infrequently. She doesn't finish movies, sometimes. She's looking for a movie that she and her husband can both enjoy and that won't bore her to death. Fatima and her husband talk about the moveis they watch with their friends. They're the kind of people that post hundreds of vacation photos on Facebook, but they don't have all kinds of accounts across various social media sites. | Fatima doesn't want to create yet another user account. She doesn't care to write reviews; but she will talk about interesting movies she's watched in person / on the phone. She doesn't really have the patience to read what other people think.
Max ![Image of Nick](personas/Max.png) | Max is in Grade 9. His favorite subjects revolve around Humanities. He loves music; he plays stringed instruments and has an interest in the theory of music. He's physically active (despite his profile pic). He plays in a band. Max has a Facebook account, an Instagram, etc., etc. Regarding movies, he'll watch every now and then. When he does, he's pretty familiar with the director, writers, cast, and has preferences based on each. | Max isn't an avid movie-watcher, but when he does watch, it's largely based on what's trending, what his favorite actors and directors have produced, and maybe what his friends might have recently watched. If there's hype around a movie, he'll watch it. | Max likes to go to the theater to watch movies with hype. He doesn't really care about "finding" a movie to watch; if there's nothing that peaks his interest, he won't watch anything.
