# Layout
I'll use a 960-pixel grid system, as recommended by the UX literature, and also 
because 960 is divisible by various common screen resolutions for better 
responsive design.  

I'll use a 12 column system, because there will likely be carousels that will 
benefit from more columns. The goal should be to implement the grid system 
entirely in CSS, as opposed to referencing columns in markup; we can do this 
with CSS Grid.
