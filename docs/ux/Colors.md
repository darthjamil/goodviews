# Colors
I'd like to use a non-neutral background color for the site, because whiteish colors 
are pretty boring. Although, someone using brightness or color inversion for 
accessibility reasons will want a consistent scheme across all sites and software. 
So this could be a negative for them. I'll go with #323A45.

Movie posters will bring in their own colors, so we don't want to overload the palette. 
Thus, I'll go with a simple Complementary Color scheme, using a gold or wheat-ish color 
(#F5DEB3) for text, and a pale blue for links and button backgrounds (#85A3FF). These 
aren't strictly complementary, but they provide high contrast.

Text on background will be WCAG AAA compliant; links and buttons on background will be
AA compliant; and text in buttons will be AA compliant.
