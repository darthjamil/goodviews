# Fonts
I like think font faces, so Helvetica can be used as a heading font.
Helvetica is sans-serif, so best practices dictate that paragraph text should 
then be serif. However, what I'm going to do is use Bootstraps font-family 
declarations, because it takes into account accessibility and viewing 
on different platforms, like iOS, Android, etc., even though it uses sans-serif 
for both headings and paragraphs.  

Font size will be relative to a fixed font (rem) for easier CSS and for 
improved accessibility (since clients can change the default font size in 
the browser).
