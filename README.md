# Goodviews
Goodviews is social media site for movie lovers. Think, Goodreads for movies.  

The idea was inspired by my sister. The purpose of this website is to learn
fullstack development, including backend, frontend, CI/CD, UX, SEO, and more.

## Technology Stack
Eventually this site will use the following technologies:  

- Backend: Dotnet Core 3.1
- Frontend: React (without Redux), Bootstrap (I'm questioning this)
- Ops: Azure DevOps, Ansible, some CDN
